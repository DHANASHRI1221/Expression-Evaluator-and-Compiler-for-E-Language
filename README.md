# Expression Evaluator and Compiler for E++ Language

## Overview
This project implements an efficient expression evaluator and compiler for the E++ language, focusing on mathematical and symbolic expressions. E++ is a hypothetical language defined with specific rules and utilizes the `UnlimitedInt` and `UnlimitedRational` classes for numerical operations.

## Features
- **Expression Evaluator**: Evaluates mathematical and symbolic expressions according to E++ language rules.
- **Compiler**: Translates E++ programs into machine code using data structures like AVL trees, MinHeap, and Stack.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C++ (assuming based on the nature of the project)
- **Data Structures**: AVL Trees, MinHeap, Stack
- **Classes**: UnlimitedInt, UnlimitedRational (used for handling arbitrary precision integers and rationals)
